"""Recommendation confidence for one film: how each model ranks it for this user, and how much they agree.

Every number comes from the live engine. For each source the film's score is turned into a percentile
among all films that source can score for this user (100 = its top film). Sources are grouped in user
words: Collaborative (SVD, item CF, user CF), Content (TF-IDF and labels), Behavioral (implicit ALS),
Popularity (what everyone rates well; it carries real weight for new users, so it is shown too).
Hybrid is the calibrated Match %. Agreement = 100 x (1 - 2 x standard deviation of the source
percentiles that count for this user's stage), so identical rankings give 100 and a split between the
very top and the very bottom gives 0. It needs at least two sources that score the film.
