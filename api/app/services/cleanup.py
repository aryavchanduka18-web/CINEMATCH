"""Housekeeping that keeps the free database (Neon, 1 GB) from filling up.

- Guest accounts with no activity for GUEST_IDLE_DAYS are deleted (their ratings, list and history go
  with them through ON DELETE CASCADE). Guests who signed up are no longer guests, so they are never touched.
- recommendation_logs (one row per film shown, used only for offline analysis) older than LOG_KEEP_DAYS
  are deleted.

It runs once shortly after start-up and then every CLEANUP_EVERY_HOURS while the server is awake.
