        FlickRaven is a free movie recommendation website run by one person as a personal project. It does not stream
        films, show ads, or sell or share your data with anyone.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>What we store</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Your email address, the name you choose, and your password stored as a one-way hash (we cannot read it).</li>
          <li>What you tell us about your taste: onboarding picks, languages and genres, ratings, likes and dislikes (with the reason, if you give one), My List and films marked as watched.</li>
          <li>Films you open or click in search, and the recommendations shown to you, so the site can learn your taste. Records of recommendations shown are deleted after 60 days.</li>
          <li>If you import a Letterboxd or IMDb file, only the ratings that match our catalog are kept. The file itself is not stored.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">We do not collect your location, contacts, or payment details.</p>

        <h2>Guests</h2>
        <p>If you browse without an account, the same data is kept under a guest session. A guest session with no activity for 30 days is deleted automatically, with everything in it.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>One cookie keeps you signed in (or keeps your guest session). There are no advertising or tracking cookies and no third-party analytics.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Where it is kept and who else is involved</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The website runs on Render and the database on Neon, both in Singapore.</li>
          <li>Posters and photos load directly from The Movie Database (TMDB), so TMDB can see your IP address when images load.</li>
          <li>The site owner can see overall usage numbers (for example, how many people signed up this week), not what any one person watches.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You can change or remove any rating, like, list entry or watched mark at any time.</li>
          <li>You can delete your account on the <Link to="/account">Account</Link> page. This removes your account and everything linked to it immediately and for good.</li>
          <li>There is no password reset, because FlickRaven does not send emails. Keep your password safe.</li>
        </ul>
