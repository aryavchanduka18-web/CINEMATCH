# CineMatch Spec

**Version 1.1. Approved by Aryav on 2026-10-07 with the changes listed below. No more redesign; build from this.**

- This is the single source of truth for the build.
- It is Aryav's v1.0 plan (posted in the project chat) with the fixes from [plan-review.md](plan-review.md) applied. Details Aryav's plan adopted from [plan.md](plan.md) (schema, API, folders) are copied in here, so this file stands alone.
- 2026-10-07 changes from Aryav's review: 2–3 large cards per row on desktop; onboarding picks no longer count toward the user's stage; American spelling throughout.
- Home rails: Aryav chose "Use real data" on 2026-10-07 (13 rails; awards from Wikidata; Trending merged into New & Notable; Critically Acclaimed dropped).
- Rule for the build: follow this spec. If something in it turns out wrong or impossible during the build, raise it in the thread before changing it. Never change it silently.

Change log:
- v1.0: Aryav's plan, 2026-10-07.
- v1.1: merged spec with review fixes, plus Aryav's two final changes (card density, stage counter), 2026-10-07.

## 1. Product

**One line (for the report):** CineMatch is an explainable hybrid movie recommendation engine that combines content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, implicit and explicit feedback, cold-start adaptation and diversity-aware reranking to give personalized, user-controllable movie discovery.

**What it is:** a movie discovery website whose job is to show a recommendation engine working. It is **not** a streaming site.
- No video player, no Play button, no playback, no trailers hosted by us.
- Clicking a movie opens its detail page.

**Problems it addresses (and the claim we make):**
- New-user cold start, new-movie cold start, popularity bias, repetitive lists, unexplained recommendations, no user control.
- Claim: the hybrid gives a **better overall trade-off** between relevance, cold-start performance, coverage, diversity and novelty than any single model. Not "hybrid wins every metric". Never "better than Netflix".

**Three ideas that define the product:**
1. **Why this movie?** Every personal recommendation carries a real, plain-English reason.
2. **Familiar ↔ Balanced ↔ Discover.** The user controls how adventurous the list is, and the control really changes the reranking.
3. **Diverse lists.** The engine checks whether its picks are too alike before showing them.

**Not built:** streaming or video, multiple profiles per account, real-time model retraining, microservices or distributed infrastructure, chatbots, invented data (subtitles, audio tracks, content advisories, critic scores).

---

## 2. Scope

**Core (the finished project must have all of these):**
- Models: popularity, content-based, user CF, item CF, Funk SVD with fold-in, implicit ALS with fold-in, hybrid.
- Engine: candidate generation, filters, score normalization, switching + weighted blend by user stage, calibrated Match %, MMR diversity and novelty reranking, Discovery Mode, explanations, Surprise Me, For Tonight (constraint-based, with relaxation).
- Cold start: onboarding for new users; content features for new movies.
- Product: accounts and database-backed guests, onboarding, home with hero and 13 rails, movie pages, Quick View, Discover, Genres, Search, My List, Activity, Taste Profile.
- Research Lab at `/lab` and the full offline evaluation.
- Viva notes for every phase (section 15).

**Advanced (built after the core is evaluated and stable, in this order):**
1. Shilling attack and defense (lab only).
2. Taste map with PCA (lab only).
3. Neural Collaborative Filtering (lab only, never served on the website).

## 3. Architecture, stack and where it runs

```
             OFFLINE (pipeline, run by us)
  MovieLens + TMDB + Wikidata -> pipeline scripts -> artifacts/ (models, metrics, lab data)
                                                  -> Postgres (catalog, aggregates)

             ONLINE (the website)
  Browser (React) <-> FastAPI <-> Postgres (users, ratings, events, lists)
                         |
                         +-- loads artifacts/ once at startup
                         +-- engine package: profile -> candidates -> blend -> calibrate -> rerank -> explain
```

- The same `cinematch_engine` Python package is used by the offline evaluation and by the live API. **The model we evaluate is the model the website serves.**
- Heavy work (feature building, training, evaluation) is offline. Per request, the API only does cheap work: fold-in, neighbor look-ups, blending, reranking, explanations.

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion |
| Backend | Python 3.12 (already on the laptop), FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 in Docker (Docker Desktop and WSL2 are already on the laptop) |
| ML | NumPy, pandas, SciPy (sparse matrices), scikit-learn, scikit-surprise (Funk SVD), implicit (ALS), PyTorch (NCF only) |
| Tests | pytest (engine, API, scenario tests), Vitest for key frontend logic |

**Where it runs:**
- On Aryav's laptop, in `C:\PROJECTS\RS PROJECT`, built through Remote Control.
- Reason: the data sites (MovieLens, TMDB, Wikidata) are blocked from the cloud workspace, and the demo runs on the laptop anyway.
- Code is pushed to a private GitHub repository after every phase.
- Laptop checked on 2026-10-07: Windows 11, 15.4 GB RAM, Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, 200 GB free; Git, Python 3.12, Node 24, Docker and WSL2 installed; no PostgreSQL. So the project uses **Python 3.12** (changed from 3.11 to avoid an extra install) and **PostgreSQL in Docker**. scikit-surprise 1.1.5 and implicit 0.7.3 both ship ready-made Windows packages for Python 3.12, so no compiler is needed.

## 4. Data

### 4.1 Sources
| Source | Used for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **MovieLens 32M** | All ratings: CF, SVD, ALS, evaluation, community-rating aggregates | Ratings run up to 2023. `links.csv` maps each film to its TMDB and IMDb ids. |
| **TMDB API** | Metadata, posters, backdrops, title logos, credits, keywords, certifications; recent releases | Needs Aryav's free API key. Attribution notice and logo in the site footer (TMDB terms). |
| **Wikidata** | Awards (won / nominated) | Free, no key. Matched by TMDB movie id (property P4947). Award received = P166, nominated for = P1411. |
| Not used | OMDb, critic scores, any scraping, the piracy site in the reference screenshots | |

**Rating scale:** MovieLens 0.5–5.0 stars × 2 = CineMatch 1–10. The site's 5-star widget with half stars gives exactly the same 10 levels.

**Implicit data, stated honestly in the report:** "Implicit training signals are derived from explicit ratings for offline experiments. Live CineMatch implicit feedback comes from real user interactions."

### 4.2 Catalog (product catalog; size set by the rules below, measured in the catalog audit)
The **product catalog** is everything the website can show. The **evaluation universe** (section 12) is only the MovieLens-linked part A films in the ratings sample, so model comparisons stay fair however large the product catalog grows.

| Part | How it's selected | Built (2026-10-08) |
|---|---|---|
| A. MovieLens backbone | Films with enough MovieLens ratings to train and evaluate user CF, item CF, SVD and ALS (threshold tuned so this part lands near 10,000; 154 ratings at the first build) that pass the metadata gate | 9,995 |
| B. International enrichment | TMDB "discover" by original language, sorted by vote count: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali, Marathi, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese and others. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada use a lower vote minimum so they can reach the 150-film onboarding rule (Aryav, 2026-10-08) | ~3,000 |
| C. Recent releases | Releases from the 18 months before the **catalog build date** (MovieLens 32M stops at 12 October 2023), with a minimum TMDB vote count | ~475 |
| D. Hollywood enrichment | Famous US films missing from A, B and C. A film is a candidate if the US is among its TMDB production countries (co-productions count). It qualifies if TMDB votes ≥ 2,000, or ≥ 1,000 and released before 1990, or ≥ 1,000 and part of a TMDB collection (franchise). "Franchise" means only that TMDB's `belongs_to_collection` field is set; no film is judged a franchise by hand. No minimum vote average: famous films count even if they are poorly rated. Thresholds live in `pipeline/catalog_config.yaml` | measured |

- **Hollywood coverage is a product-catalog goal**, not a requirement that every Hollywood film has collaborative ratings. Films without MovieLens ratings (parts B, C and D) are recommended through content, popularity and live site feedback, which is how CineMatch demonstrates new-movie cold start.
- **Catalog audit:** the pipeline writes `artifacts/metrics/catalog_audit.json` and `docs/catalog-audit.md`: size of each part, films per language, US candidates found, how many were already in A, how many were added as D, how many failed the gate and why, measured coverage of the top 500 and top 1,000 US films by TMDB votes, and the list of top-1,000 films still missing with the reason for each. Claims about coverage use only these measured numbers.

- **Metadata gate** (every film): poster, English overview of at least 15 words, at least 1 genre, a director, at least 3 cast members. A backdrop is optional (fallback: blurred poster). *Amended 2026-10-08 (Aryav): at least 10 words and at least 1 cast member; films that pass only the relaxed gate are added on top of the original cut and stay outside the evaluation backbone (see docs/decisions-log.md).*
- **Language rule:** onboarding only offers a language that has **at least 150 films** in the catalog.
- **Thin-text rule:** films with short overviews or no keywords get more weight on structured features (genre, director, cast, language) in the content model.
- Parts B, C and D have no MovieLens ratings. Only content, popularity (TMDB vote counts) and live site feedback can recommend them. This is the new-movie cold-start story.

### 4.3 One threshold table (used everywhere)
| Use | Rule |
|---|---|
| "Relevant" in every ranking metric | rating ≥ 7/10 |
| Positive signal for ALS training (offline) | rating ≥ 7/10; confidence rises with the rating |
| Ratings ≤ 5/10 | not an ALS positive; they feed SVD and the dislike logic |
| Match % calibration target | probability that the user rates the film ≥ 7/10 |
| Onboarding simulation picks | the user's earliest films rated ≥ 8/10 |

### 4.4 Ratings preparation and splits
- Keep ratings on catalog films only. Keep users with at least 20 such ratings.
- Sample about 30,000 users with a fixed seed (the laptop has 15.4 GB of RAM, which is enough). All models train on the same sample, so the comparison is fair.
- **Split per user by time:** oldest 70% train, next 10% validation, newest 20% test.
- **Second check:** one global time cutoff (everything after a date is test), reported as a robustness check.
- **New-movie holdout:** 5% of part-A films have all their ratings removed from train and validation. They are used only in the new-movie test.
- The test set is used **once**, at the end of tuning.

### 4.5 Pipeline steps
Scripts in `pipeline/`, run in order; `python -m pipeline.run_all` runs everything. Every raw download is cached on disk, so nothing is fetched twice.

| Step | Script | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `01_download_movielens.py`: download and unzip MovieLens 32M | `data/raw/ml-32m/` |
| 2 | `02_select_catalog.py`: parts A, B and C of the catalog | `catalog_ids.csv` |
| 3 | `03_fetch_tmdb.py`: one call per film with credits, keywords, release dates and images appended | `data/raw/tmdb/*.json` |
| 4 | `04_fetch_awards_wikidata.py`: awards for catalog films in a few bulk queries | `awards.parquet` |
| 5 | `05_clean.py`: metadata gate, duplicates, language codes, certifications, genre names, dominant color of each backdrop, completeness report per language | `movies_clean.parquet`, `metadata_report.json` |
| 6 | `06_ratings_prep.py`: filter, sample users, scale to 1–10 | `ratings.parquet` |
| 7 | `07_split.py`: time split, global-cutoff split, new-movie holdout | `train/val/test.parquet` |
| 8 | `08_features_content.py`: TF-IDF and structured feature blocks | `content.npz`, `vectorizer.joblib` |
| 9 | `09_train_models.py`: tune each model on validation, then train final models | `artifacts/models/` |
| 10 | `10_tune_hybrid.py`: blend weights per user stage, Match % calibration per stage | `hybrid_weights.json`, `calibration.joblib` |
| 11 | `11_evaluate.py`: every metric and experiment in section 12 | `artifacts/metrics/*.json` |
| 12 | `12_load_db.py`: movies, people, keywords, awards, aggregates, colors into Postgres | DB rows |
| 13+ | `13_shilling.py`, `14_taste_map.py`, `15_ncf.py` (advanced) | `artifacts/lab/*.json` |
| any | `export_site_feedback.py`: adds live site ratings and events to training before a retrain (run by hand) | |

## 5. Models

| # | Model | How it works | Settings tuned on validation | Role on the site |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Popularity** | Bayesian average: `score = v/(v+m)·R + m/(v+m)·C` (R = film's mean, v = its rating count, C = global mean, m = minimum-count constant). Language-aware variant. | m | "Most Loved", cold-start fallback, baseline |
| 2 | **Content-based** | TF-IDF on overview + keywords + tagline (English stop words, sublinear tf, ignore words in >50% of films) plus weighted blocks for genres, language, country, director, top-5 cast, studio. Cosine similarity. User profile = weighted average of liked films' vectors minus disliked ones. | block weights, n-grams | New films, international films, cold start, "More Like This" (with item CF), explanations |
| 3 | **User-based CF** | Pearson correlation on co-rated films, with significance weighting `min(n, 50)/50` (n = films in common). Prediction from the k most similar users' mean-centered ratings. | k, minimum overlap | "People With Your Taste Loved", explanations |
| 4 | **Item-based CF** | Adjusted cosine (ratings centered on each user's mean), shrunk when few users rated both films. Top-50 neighbors per film stored offline. | shrinkage, neighbors | "Because You Liked X", "More Like This" |
| 5 | **Funk SVD** | Matrix factorization with user and film biases, learned by SGD from known ratings only (scikit-surprise `SVD`). **Fold-in** for new users: film factors fixed, solve a small regularized least-squares problem for the user's vector from their ratings. | factors, epochs, learning rate, regularization | "Based On Your Ratings", main ranker for established users |
| 6 | **Implicit ALS** | Weighted ALS (Hu, Koren and Volinsky 2008, `implicit` library). Confidence `c = 1 + α·w`. Offline, w comes from ratings ≥ 7/10; live, from the event weights (section 6.2). Fold-in through the library's single-user recalculation. | factors, regularization, α, iterations | Uses likes, list adds, views; candidate source |
| 7 | **Hybrid** | Section 6. | blend weights per user stage | Everything personal on the site |
| A1 | Shilling defense | Section 14 | | Lab only |
| A2 | Taste map | PCA of SVD film vectors to 2D | | Lab only |
| A3 | NCF | NeuMF (GMF + MLP) in PyTorch, trained on positives with 4 sampled negatives each | | Lab only, never served (no cheap fold-in) |

Knowledge/constraint-based recommendation is covered by onboarding constraints, hard dislike filters, Discover filters and For Tonight (section 6.10). No separate ML model.

---

## 6. Recommendation engine

### 6.1 User profile (built per request)
- Explicit: site ratings (1–10), centered on the user's mean.
- Implicit: events turned into a weight per film (section 6.2), then ALS confidence.
- **Onboarding answers are preference signals, not behavior.** The picked films feed the content profile and ALS with the same weight as a like, and the chosen languages and genres feed the constraints. They are counted separately as `onboarding_count` and **never** add to the stage counter.
- **Behavioral interaction count b** = distinct films the user has rated, liked, disliked, added to My List or marked watched on the site. Views, Quick Views and search clicks still feed ALS, but they do not count toward b (opening 11 pages is not 11 opinions).
- **User stage** comes from b only: **cold** (b = 0–2), **warming** (3–10), **established** (11+).
- So a new user who picks 5 films in onboarding is still **cold** (onboarding_count = 5, b = 0) and gets onboarding + content + popularity. They move to warming only after 3 real actions.

### 6.2 Event weights (config file `engine/config/event_weights.yaml`, starting values, not "truth")
| Event | Weight |
|---|---|
| detail_view | +0.5 (once per film per day) |
| quick_view | +0.25 |
| search_click | +0.5 |
| list_add | +3 |
| list_remove | -2 |
| watched | +2 |
| like | +4 |
| dislike | -5, and the film is filtered out |
| rate | explicit rating, plus +1 for showing interest |
| hover | not logged |

### 6.3 Candidates
About 50 films from each source: popularity, content, item CF, user CF, SVD, ALS. Merged into one pool of up to ~300.

### 6.4 Filters
Remove: films already rated, marked watched, or disliked; films in disliked genres (hard rule); films already placed higher on the same page (section 7.2); films outside the catalog.

### 6.5 Normalization
Each source's scores become a 0–1 percentile rank within the user's candidate pool. A source that didn't propose a film gives it 0. Raw scores from different models are never added directly.

### 6.6 Switching + weighted blend
- `final = Σ weight[stage][source] × normalized_score[source]`.
- Weights are tuned per stage by grid search on NDCG@10 over validation users.
- **Stage tuning uses simulated users that match the live definition.** Each validation user gets simulated onboarding (5 of their earliest films rated ≥ 8/10, plus those films' genres and languages, counted as onboarding, not as b), then: cold = onboarding + 0–2 further ratings; warming = onboarding + 3–10; established = full training history. (Every MovieLens user has 20+ ratings, so without this, the cold and warming stages would be tuned on nothing.)
- Expected pattern (the real numbers come from tuning and are shown in the lab): cold = popularity + content; warming = content, item CF, ALS rising; established = SVD, ALS, item CF, user CF, small content, little popularity.
- This is a **switching hybrid** (weights change with stage) inside a **weighted hybrid** (the blend) inside a **cascade** (candidates, then blend, then rerank). Use those three names in the report.

### 6.7 Match %
- One-feature logistic regression per stage, fitted on validation: blend score → probability the user rates the film ≥ 7/10.
- Match % = that probability × 100, rounded, capped at 99.
- Expect most values between 60% and 90%. Do not stretch them.
- **Community rating** is separate: Bayesian average of MovieLens and site ratings on the 1–10 scale.

### 6.8 Diversity reranking (MMR) and Discovery Mode
- Take the top 100 by blend score and pick one film at a time:
  `next = argmax [ λ·relevance(i) − (1−λ)·max_similarity(i, picked) + β·novelty(i) ]`
- similarity = content cosine; novelty = −log(popularity share), scaled 0–1.

| Mode | λ | β | Extra |
|---|---|---|---|
| Familiar | 0.95 | 0 | none |
| Balanced (default) | 0.75 | 0.05 | none |
| Discover | 0.55 | 0.20 | small boost for films outside the user's languages and for genres rare in their history |

The mode is saved in `user_preferences.discovery_mode`.

### 6.9 Surprise Me
1. Unseen hybrid candidates with Match % ≥ 60 and community rating ≥ 6.5/10.
2. Main genre not in the user's top 3 genres.
3. Below the 70th popularity percentile.
4. Weighted random pick by Match %. Reason: "Outside your usual genres, but people with similar taste rated it highly." Logged with `source = surprise_me`.

### 6.10 For Tonight (constraint-based recommendation)
- **Inputs:** mood (Funny / Scary / Intense / Relaxed / Feel-good / Mind-bending), runtime band (< 90, 90–120, 120+), language (any or chosen), optional genres.
- **Knowledge base:** `engine/config/moods.yaml` maps each mood to genres and keywords. Example: Scary = Horror, or Thriller with keywords such as "supernatural" or "serial killer". This rule table *is* the knowledge base; the viva notes say so.
- **Steps:** apply the constraints as hard filters, then rank the survivors by the user's hybrid score, then show the top 10 with reasons.
- **Relaxation when nothing matches:** relax in this order: runtime band (widen by one band), then genres, then mood (nearest mood), and language last. Tell the user what was relaxed: "No Malayalam horror under 90 minutes, so here are some up to 120."
- "Perfect Popcorn Films" is a fixed preset of this feature (section 7).

### 6.11 Explanations
- Each film keeps its per-source scores. Reasons come from the sources that really contributed.
- Rules: at most 3 reasons; a reason is shown only if its source gave **at least 20% of the final score**; evidence must be real (a real film the user liked, a real count of similar users). The lab's User Inspector shows the numbers behind every reason.

| Source | Example | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Item CF | Because you liked *Prisoners* | the user's liked film with the highest similarity |
| Content | Similar themes to *Zodiac* and *Se7en* | top 2 liked films by content similarity |
| User CF | 14 people with similar taste rated this 8+ | real neighbor count |
| SVD / ALS | Fits the kind of films you rate highly | the user's top genre among high ratings |
| Preferences | Matches your interest in Korean thrillers | onboarding answers |
| Popularity | Loved by CineMatch viewers | none |
| Rerank | Adds variety to your list | the genre it adds |

### 6.12 Freshness
Personal rails are recomputed on every home-page load, and any rating, like, dislike or list change takes effect on the next load. No stale caching of personal results.

## 7. Home page rails

### 7.1 The rails
Hero: the top 5 picks (hybrid + MMR in the user's current mode), rotating. Hero films are not repeated in the rails.

| # | Rail | Powered by | Definition | Shown when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Top Picks For You | Full hybrid + MMR | the main output | always |
| 2 | Because You Liked "X" | Item CF (content fallback for films with few ratings) | neighbors of the film the user most recently liked, rated ≥ 8/10 or picked in onboarding; up to 2 of these rails | ≥ 1 like, high rating or onboarding pick |
| 3 | Continue Exploring | Recent views | films opened in the last 14 days and not yet rated, listed or disliked; newest first | ≥ 1 view |
| 4 | Based On Your Ratings | SVD only | the explicit-ratings model on its own | ≥ 5 ratings |
| 5 | People With Your Taste Loved | User CF only | films the user's nearest neighbors rated highly | ≥ 10 ratings and ≥ 20 usable neighbors |
| 6 | Movies In Your Languages | Hybrid + language constraint | the user's chosen languages | always |
| 7 | New & Notable | Content + TMDB popularity | releases from the last 18 months (catalog part C), ranked by content match × popularity; live new-movie cold start | always |
| 8 | Hidden Gems | Hybrid + popularity rule | Bayesian rating ≥ 7.5/10 and in the less popular half of the catalog | always |
| 9 | Award Winners & Nominees | Wikidata awards + hybrid | award-won or nominated films, ranked for the user | enough items |
| 10 | Perfect Popcorn Films | For Tonight preset | Action, Adventure, Comedy, Animation or Sci-Fi; 90–130 min; Bayesian rating ≥ 6.5/10; ranked by hybrid | always |
| 11 | International Cinema | Hybrid + language constraint | films **outside** the user's chosen languages | always |
| 12 | Most Loved | Popularity baseline | Bayesian average, language-aware | always |
| 13 | Discover Something Different | Discover-mode MMR | λ = 0.55, β = 0.20 whatever the slider says | always |

Dropped from v1.0: **Trending Now** (no live trend data; merged into New & Notable) and **Critically Acclaimed** (no critic data; would copy Most Loved).

### 7.2 Page rules
- **No duplicates:** the server plans the whole page in one call, filling rails top-down, and a film appears **at most once** on the page.
- **Hide short rails:** a rail with fewer than 8 films after de-duplication is hidden.
- **Stage-based rail count:** about 7 rails for a brand-new user, up to 13 for an established one (from the "Shown when" column).
- **Page weight:** only rails near the screen are drawn; images load lazily at the size they are displayed.
- Every card shown is logged in `recommendation_logs` with its rail, position, scores and reason.

## 8. Pages, navigation and UI

### 8.1 Navigation
```
[CineMatch logo]  Home  Discover  Genres  My List  Activity        [search]  [avatar]
```
- Active tab: light pill, dark text. Inactive: plain. Hover: subtle gray pill.
- Navbar: slightly see-through at the top of the page, solid near-black after about 80 px of scroll.
- Avatar menu: Taste Profile, Preferences (edit onboarding answers), Sign out. Guests see "Create account".
- Phone: logo, search and avatar at the top; the five tabs in a bottom tab bar.
- `/lab` is not in the navigation (a small footer link for the demo).

### 8.2 Routes
`/` Home · `/discover` · `/genres` · `/genres/:slug` · `/movie/:id` · `/my-list` · `/activity` · `/search?q=` · `/login` · `/register` · `/onboarding` · `/lab`

| Lab | Section 13. |

### 8.4 Movie cards
- **Shape:** landscape 16:9 backdrop. Title drawn as text over a dark gradient at the bottom; TMDB title logo used where it exists.
- **Density (Aryav's design decision, 2026-10-07):** large cards, about 2–3 visible per rail on desktop with the next card partly visible; about 2 on tablet; about 1–1.5 on phone.
- **Normal state:** artwork, title, year, community rating, language, Match % on personal rails.
- **Hover (desktop only):** scale about 1.05, lift 4 px, 150–250 ms, after a short hover-intent delay so moving across a rail doesn't flicker. Reveals Match %, genre, one-line synopsis, Like, Dislike, Add to List, and the Quick View chevron. Rails have vertical padding so enlarged cards are never clipped.
- **Touch:** no hover panel. Tap opens the movie page. The chevron is always visible.
- **Rail arrows:** glass style (see-through, light blur, thin light border, round), fade in when the pointer enters the rail, smooth scroll.

### 8.5 Hero
- Large backdrop of the current pick, blurred artwork plus a subtle tint from its precomputed dominant color, dark overlay for readable text.
- Shows: title, year, runtime, genres, language, Match %, community rating, one-line reason, View Details, Add to My List, Like, Dislike. **No Play button.**
- Arrows and dots to move between the 5 picks. Changing pick: 400–600 ms crossfade, metadata moves slightly.
- On scroll: the hero compresses and the navbar turns solid.

### 8.6 Visual identity
- Colors: background `#080808`, surface `#141414`, surface 2 `#1B1B1B`, text `#FFFFFF`, muted `#A7A7A7`. Accent: CineMatch crimson about `#C8102E` (hover `#E0263F`), used for Match %, active rating stars and focus rings, never for large blocks.
- Fonts (free): Inter for interface text; Inter Tight or Manrope for titles.
- Motion: 150–250 ms for interactions, 400–600 ms for the hero. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Not allowed:** purple or blue "AI" gradients, neon, glowing borders, floating blobs, gradient headline text, glass everywhere, oversized pills, 3D tilt cards, particles, constant motion, bounce effects, generic dashboard layouts.
- Footer: TMDB attribution notice and logo.

Shared hooks: `useFeedback(movieId)` (optimistic updates for like/list/rate), `useLogEvent()`, `useRecs(mode)`.

Design tokens, card behavior and motion: section 8. They live in `tailwind.config.ts` and `styles/tokens.css`.

Small technical traps:
- **Dominant color**: compute it in the pipeline (from the backdrop image, with Pillow) and store it in `movies.dominant_color`. Reading pixels in the browser from TMDB images hits cross-origin canvas errors.
- **Image sizes**: cards are large (roughly 550–750 px wide on desktop), so they use TMDB `w780` backdrops with `w1280` for high-density screens (`srcset`), `w1280` for the hero, `w342` posters for Quick View. Never `original`. All images below the fold use lazy loading.

## 10. Database schema (PostgreSQL)

Rule: **MovieLens ratings do not go into Postgres.** 25 to 32 million rows are only needed for training. They live as Parquet files in the pipeline. Postgres stores the catalog, aggregates, and the website's own users and events.

```sql
-- Catalog

-- What we showed, so the lab can show click-through per rail and per model

)
```

Notes:
- `ratings`, `reactions`, `user_movie_list`, `watched` hold **current state** (fast reads for the UI). `interactions` holds **history** (what the engine and Activity page read). Every action writes to both. This avoids recomputing state from the log on every page load.
- Event weights live in a config file (`engine/config/event_weights.yaml`), not the DB. Easier to version and to show in the lab.
- Hover is **not logged**. It is noise and floods the table.
- Mood rules (`moods.yaml`), rail rules (`rails.yaml`) and the threshold table (`thresholds.yaml`) are config files too.

Recommendation item shape:
```json
{
  "movie": {"id": 123, "title": "...", "year": 2013, "poster": "...", "backdrop": "...",
            "genres": ["Crime","Thriller"], "language": "en", "runtime": 153,
            "logo": "...", "community_rating": 8.1, "dominant_color": "#2a3b4c", "overview_short": "..."},
  "score": 0.83,
  "match_pct": 87,
  "reasons": [{"code": "item_cf", "text": "Because you liked Prisoners", "anchor_movie_id": 45, "share": 0.41}],
  "user_state": {"rating": null, "reaction": 0, "in_list": false, "watched": false}
}
```
- `user_state` is included so cards render buttons correctly without extra calls.
- `reasons` holds at most 3 entries; `share` is that source's part of the final score (section 6.11).

## 12. Evaluation

### 12.1 Protocol
- Per-user time split (section 4.4). The global-cutoff split is a second check.
- **Evaluated users:** a fixed random sample of about 5,000 test users who have at least one relevant test film (same sample for every model and experiment).
- **Full ranking:** each model ranks every catalog film the user has not rated in training. No "1 relevant + 99 random" sampling (sampled metrics can reorder models; Krichene and Rendle, 2020).
- **Fair tuning:** each model's own settings are tuned on validation first (section 5), then the hybrid is tuned on top. The test set is used once.
- **Uncertainty:** report each metric with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval over users. Small gaps (for example, hybrid vs SVD) are only claimed if the intervals support it.

### 12.2 Which metrics apply to which model
| Model | MAE / RMSE | P@10, R@10, MAP@10, NDCG@10 | Coverage, diversity, novelty, long-tail share |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bias baseline (global mean + user bias + film bias) | yes | n/a | n/a |
| Popularity | n/a | yes | yes |
| Content-based | n/a | yes | yes |
| User CF | yes | yes | yes |
| Item CF | yes | yes | yes |
| Funk SVD | yes | yes | yes |
| Implicit ALS | n/a | yes | yes |
| Hybrid (each Discovery Mode) | n/a | yes | yes |
| NCF (advanced) | n/a | yes | yes |

"n/a" because those models rank films and do not predict a rating.

### 12.3 Metric definitions
- Relevant = test rating ≥ 7/10 (section 4.3).
- **Catalog coverage:** share of the catalog that appears in at least one evaluated user's top 10.
- **Intra-list diversity:** 1 − average content similarity between pairs of films in a top-10 list.
- **Novelty:** average −log2(popularity share) of recommended films.
- **Popularity bias:** long-tail share (percent of recommended films from the less popular 80% of the catalog) and average popularity percentile of recommended films.

### 12.4 Experiments
1. **Model comparison:** the table in 12.2 on the test set.
2. **Cold-start users:** for each evaluated user, keep only k behavioral ratings, k = 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, in two versions: **without onboarding** (their earliest k ratings) and **with onboarding** (simulated onboarding as in section 6.6, plus the next k ratings). Test films are always later ones. Chart: NDCG@10 against k, one line per model, solid with onboarding and dashed without. The gap between the two lines is what onboarding is worth.
3. **New movies:** for the held-out films (section 4.4), hit rate@50 = how often a held-out film the user later rated ≥ 7/10 appears in their top 50. Compare content, CF models and hybrid. Expected: CF models score zero, content and hybrid do not.
4. **Diversity trade-off:** sweep λ from 0.5 to 1.0 in steps of 0.05. Chart: NDCG@10 against intra-list diversity, with Familiar, Balanced and Discover marked.
5. **Calibration check:** predicted Match % against the observed share of relevant films, per user stage.
6. **Global-cutoff check:** the model comparison rerun on the global time split.

All results are written to `artifacts/metrics/*.json`; the lab reads only these files.

---

## 13. Research Lab (`/lab`)

A plain, professional page for the professor. It exposes the engine; it is not an analytics dashboard.

- **Models:** each model, what it does, its role on the site, its tuned settings.
- **Model comparison:** the table from 12.2 with confidence intervals.
- **Cold start:** NDCG@10 against known ratings, one line per model, plus the onboarding point.
- **New movies:** the hit-rate result.
- **Diversity:** NDCG@10 against diversity, with the three modes marked.
- **Hybrid weights:** the tuned weights per user stage.
- **User Inspector:** pick a site user or a sample MovieLens user and see their stage, onboarding count, behavioral interaction count, and for each recommended film the per-source scores, final score, Match % and the reasons shown on the site.
- **Catalog audit:** catalog composition per part, films per language, and measured Hollywood coverage (top 500 and top 1,000 US films), read from `artifacts/metrics/catalog_audit.json`.
- **Advanced panels:** shilling results, taste map, NCF row (when built).
- Charts follow one consistent style; numbers come only from `artifacts/`.

---

## 14. Advanced modules

### 14.1 Shilling attack and defense (lab only, precomputed)
- **Targets:** 5 low-popularity films.
- **Attacks:** average attack and bandwagon attack; attack size 1%, 3% and 5% of users; filler of about 5% of the catalog per fake profile.
- **Measure:** prediction shift on the target films and hit ratio@10 (share of real users who get the target in their top 10), for user CF, item CF and SVD, before and after the attack.
- **Defense:** flag suspicious profiles with simple detection features (rating deviation from the film's mean agreement, similarity to their nearest neighbors, rating variance), remove them, retrain, measure again.
- **Report the defense's cost:** detection precision and recall, and the false-positive rate (real users wrongly removed).
- No live attack controls on the website.

### 14.2 Taste map (lab only)
- PCA of SVD film vectors to 2D, colored by main genre. The current user's folded-in vector is placed with the same projection and labeled "You".
- Not t-SNE: t-SNE cannot place a new user without redrawing the whole map.
- It is a picture of the model, not a recommender.

### 14.3 NCF (lab only)
- NeuMF (GMF + MLP) in PyTorch on CPU, trained on positives (rating ≥ 7/10) with 4 sampled negatives per positive.
- Evaluated with exactly the same full-ranking protocol as the other models.
- Not served on the website: it learns one vector per training user and has no cheap fold-in.
- If it loses to SVD or ALS, report it plainly (Rendle et al., 2020 found the same).

---

## 15. Implementation phases

Every phase ends with: run it, test it (unit + scenario tests), fix it, commit and push, and write that phase's **viva notes** page in `docs/viva/` (what was built, the formula in plain English, why it was chosen, and the 5 questions an examiner is most likely to ask).

| Phase | Work | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Foundation | Git repo, Vite app, FastAPI app, Postgres in Docker, SQLAlchemy + Alembic, `.env`, test runners | The web app calls the API, the API reads the database, tests run |
| 2. Data pipeline | Steps 1–8 and 12 (section 4.5) | Catalog in Postgres; metadata report per language; 20 films spot-checked by hand |
| 3. Baseline models | Popularity, content, user CF, item CF; the evaluation code with unit tests on a tiny hand-made dataset | Metrics for 4 models on validation |
| 4. Matrix factorization | Funk SVD + fold-in, ALS + fold-in | Metrics; fold-in checked against full retraining for a few users |
| 5. Hybrid engine | Candidates, filters, normalization, stage weights, calibration, MMR, explanations, Surprise Me, For Tonight logic | Hybrid metrics; calibration check passes |
| 6. Experiments | Cold start, new movies, diversity sweep, global-cutoff check | All lab JSON files exist |
| 7. Frontend foundation | Shell, navigation, cards, rails, arrows, movie page, auth, guest users, onboarding | Register, onboard, see recommendations |
| 8. Integration + core feedback | Engine served through the API; **rating, like and dislike** | Scenario test "rating changes recommendations" passes |
| 9. Full interaction system | My List, watched, event logging, Activity, Taste Profile, recommendation logs | Every action shows in Activity and in the engine |
| 10. Premium frontend | Hero and transitions, dominant color, hover cards, glass arrows, Quick View, navbar on scroll, Discovery Mode control, rating animation, For Tonight panel, loading and empty states, responsive layouts | Checked at desktop, tablet and phone widths; no clipping; nothing hover-only on touch |
| 11. Research Lab | Section 13 | Every number traceable to an `artifacts/` file |
| 12. Advanced | Shilling, then taste map, then NCF | Each has its lab panel |
| 13. Final validation and demo prep | All scenario tests, report, demo accounts, backup video | Demo rehearsed end to end |

---

## 16. Scenario tests (run after every phase from Phase 8 on)

1. **New user:** onboarding with 5 crime thrillers returns recommendations, most of the top 20 are crime, thriller or mystery, and the user is still **cold** (onboarding_count = 5, b = 0).
2. **Stage counter:** views alone never change the stage; after 3 ratings or likes the stage becomes "warming" and the blend weights change accordingly.
3. **Established user:** after 15+ ratings, CF sources carry most of the weight.
4. **Rating changes the list:** rating three crime thrillers 9+ changes the top 20, and at least 5 of them are crime or thriller.
5. **Dislike:** a disliked film never appears again; a disliked genre disappears from personal rails.
6. **My List:** adding a film raises the scores of similar films (implicit signal works).
7. **Discovery Mode:** Discover gives higher intra-list diversity than Familiar for the same user.
8. **New movie:** a New & Notable film with zero MovieLens ratings can reach a user's rails through content.
9. **Item similarity:** "Because You Liked *Prisoners*" contains films a person would accept as similar (checked by hand once, then frozen as a regression list).
10. **User CF:** the prepared demo account has at least 20 usable neighbors and a full "People With Your Taste" rail.
11. **No duplicates:** no film appears twice on the home page.
12. **Explanations:** every reason shown matches a source that gave at least 20% of the score.

---

## 17. Demo plan

Two accounts:
- **Fresh account** (created live) for demos 1–3.
- **Prepared account** with about 40 real ratings for demos 4–8, so user CF has enough data.

| # | Demo | Account | What to say |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign up, pick 5 films, languages, genres; recommendations appear | Fresh | Cold start: the user is still "cold" (5 onboarding picks, 0 real actions), so onboarding + content + popularity drive the list |
| 2 | Rate *Prisoners* 9, *Se7en* 10, *Zodiac* 9, reload | Fresh | 3 real actions: the stage switches to "warming" (show it in the User Inspector) and fold-in updates the profile without retraining |
| 3 | Open a recommended film, show "Why you're seeing this" | Fresh | Explanations come from the sources that contributed |
| 4 | "Because You Liked *Prisoners*" | Prepared | Item-based CF, adjusted cosine |
| 5 | "People With Your Taste Loved" | Prepared | User-based CF, Pearson with significance weighting |
| 6 | Switch Familiar to Discover | Prepared | MMR reranking; show the diversity chart in the lab |
| 7 | Hidden Gems and New & Notable | Prepared | Popularity bias and new-movie cold start |
| 8 | Research Lab | either | Model table, cold-start chart, User Inspector |

Backup: a recorded video of the full demo in case the laptop or network fails.

## 19. Before Phase 1

Needed from Aryav:
1. **Deadline:** the date of the demo or viva.
2. **TMDB API key:** free account at themoviedb.org. It goes in a `.env` file on the laptop; never pasted in chat.
3. **GitHub:** a private repository connected to this project.
4. ~~Laptop RAM~~: checked, 15.4 GB.
5. **College rule:** whether AI-written code is allowed for the mini project and whether it must be disclosed.

Laptop tools checked on 2026-10-07: Git, Python 3.12, Node 24, Docker and WSL2 are installed. PostgreSQL runs in Docker.
