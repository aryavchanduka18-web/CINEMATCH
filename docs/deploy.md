# Putting CineMatch online with Render

This guide takes CineMatch from your laptop to a public web address. You do every step yourself in
your browser and one terminal window. Nothing here costs money on the free plans, and nothing in the
repository contains a password or key.

## What gets hosted

| Piece | Where it runs on Render | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Website and API | One **web service** built from the `Dockerfile` | Your GitHub repository (`main` branch) |
| Database | One **PostgreSQL** database on **Neon** (not Render) | Created empty on Neon, URL pasted into Render |
| Film catalog (14,292 films, people, credits, keywords, awards) | Inside the database | Uploaded from your laptop (`catalog.dump`, about 14 MB) |
| Demo account (`demo@cinematch.local`, same password as on your laptop) | Inside the database | Uploaded from your laptop (`demo_user.json`) |
| Trained models and the Research Lab numbers | Inside the database, unpacked by the server at start | Uploaded from your laptop (`artifacts.tar.gz`, about 38 MB) |

Why the models travel through the database: the GitHub repository is public, and the models are built
from MovieLens ratings, which may not be redistributed. The database is private to your Render account,
so the models never become public.

Memory: with the same 512 MB limit as Render's free plan, the container peaked at about 380 MB while
serving the home page, film pages, search and the Research Lab (measured in Docker on the laptop). The
free plan fits. The database uses about 240 MB of the free plan's 1 GB.

## Before you start

- A Render account (you have one), signed in with GitHub so Render can see the repository.
- Docker Desktop running on the laptop (the upload uses it), and the local database started:
  `scripts\db.ps1 start`.
- All pull requests merged into `main` on GitHub. Render deploys `main`.

## Step 1: create the service and the database

1. Open <https://dashboard.render.com>, click **New**, then **Blueprint**.
2. Pick the `CINEMATCH` repository. Render finds `render.yaml` and shows the `cinematch` web service.
3. Render asks for two values: `DATABASE_URL` (the Neon URL, see "Database on Neon") and `WEB_ORIGIN`.
   Type `https://cinematch.onrender.com` for the second.
   (If Render gives the service a different address, change this value to that address in the
   service's **Environment** tab. The site works in the meantime.)
4. Click **Apply**. Render creates the database, builds the Docker image (about 5 to 10 minutes the
   first time), starts the service, and creates all the tables.
5. Wait until the web service shows **Live**. Open `https://<your address>/api/health`. You should see
   `{"status":"ok","db":"ok",...}`. The home page opens too, but has no films yet.

## Step 2: copy the catalog, demo account and models from the laptop

1. Copy the Neon URL (Neon project, **Connect**, pooling off). Treat it like a password: do not paste it into chats, files or GitHub.
2. In a terminal in the `cinematch` folder, make the three upload files:

   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\deploy_data.py export
   ```

   It prints the sizes, for example `catalog.dump 14.3 MB` and `artifacts.tar.gz 38.0 MB`. The files go
   to `deploy-out\`, which git ignores.
3. Upload them:

   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\deploy_data.py upload
   ```

   Paste the Neon URL when it asks (the text stays hidden). It takes a minute or two and
   prints `1/3 Catalog`, `2/3 Demo account`, `3/3 Model bundle`, then `Done`.
4. In Render, open the **cinematch** service, click **Manual Deploy**, then **Restart service**.
5. Open the site. The home page now shows the hero and the rails. The first visit after a restart can
   take about 10 seconds while the recommender loads.

The model bundle goes up in parts of 2 MB (`part 1/19 done` and so on); each part is saved on its own, so a
dropped connection only costs that part, and the script reconnects and carries on by itself. At the end it
checks the whole bundle against its checksum on the server.

Running `upload` again is always safe: it skips the catalog, the demo account and the bundle when they are
already there, and finishes a bundle upload that stopped half way.

## Updating the site later

- **Code changes**: merge into `main`. Render rebuilds and redeploys by itself (`autoDeploy`).
  Database changes (Alembic migrations) run automatically when the new version starts.
- **New models**: run the pipeline on the laptop, then `deploy_data.py export` and `upload` again, then
  **Restart service**.
- **New films or catalog changes** (for example the franchise update, which added 470 films and the
  franchise names): run `export`, then

  ```powershell
  .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\deploy_data.py upload --refresh-catalog
  ```

  It updates every film by its TMDB id and adds the new ones. Nothing is deleted, so accounts, ratings and
  lists made on the site stay as they are. It also uploads the new model bundle. Then **Restart service**.

## Things to know about the free plans

- The free web service **sleeps after 15 minutes without visitors**. The next visit wakes it, which takes
  about a minute. Open the site a few minutes before a demo.
- Render's free database expires after 30 days and is deleted 14 days later, so the database now lives on
  **Neon** (free plan, no expiry, 1 GB per project; CineMatch uses about 240 MB). See "Database on Neon" below.
- Sign-in lockout counters are kept in the server's memory, so a restart clears them.
- There is no email service, so the site cannot send password reset or verification emails.

## Database on Neon

The web service stays on Render; only `DATABASE_URL` points somewhere else. To move an existing Render
database to Neon without losing accounts:

1. On <https://neon.com> create a project: Postgres **17**, region **AWS Asia Pacific (Singapore)**. Under
   **Connect**, turn connection pooling **off** and copy the connection string (the Neon URL).
2. Copy the Render database across with the `postgres:17` image (Docker Desktop running, in the `cinematch`
   folder). `Read-Host` keeps the URLs out of PowerShell's history:

   ```powershell
   mkdir deploy-out -Force
   $src = Read-Host "Paste the Render External Database URL"
   $dst = Read-Host "Paste the Neon URL"
   docker run --rm -e SRC=$src -v "${PWD}\deploy-out:/out" postgres:17 sh -c 'pg_dump "$SRC" -Fc --no-owner --no-privileges -f /out/full.dump'
   docker run --rm -e DST=$dst -v "${PWD}\deploy-out:/out" postgres:17 sh -c 'pg_restore --no-owner --no-privileges -d "$DST" /out/full.dump'
   ```

   A few warnings about extension ownership are normal. Delete `deploy-out\full.dump` afterwards: it holds
   user accounts.
3. In the Render service's **Environment** tab set `DATABASE_URL` to the Neon URL (if it is still linked to
   `cinematch-db`, delete it and add it again as a plain value), then **Manual Deploy**.
4. Check `/api/health` shows `"db":"ok"`. Later uploads (`deploy_data.py upload`) take the Neon URL.

For a brand-new setup, create the Neon project first, give its URL as `DATABASE_URL` when Render asks, and
follow Step 2 above with the Neon URL.

Neon's free compute pauses after about 5 minutes idle and wakes in under a second; `pool_pre_ping` in
`api/app/db.py` replaces connections it dropped.

## If something goes wrong

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| Build fails on Render | Open the service's **Logs**. Most often a download timed out: click **Manual Deploy**, then **Deploy latest commit**. |
| `/api/health` shows `"db":"error"` | The database is still starting, or the service lost its `DATABASE_URL`. In the **Environment** tab, `DATABASE_URL` must be the Neon URL. |
| `upload` says the database has no CineMatch tables | The service has not finished its first start. Wait for **Live**, then run `upload` again. |
| `upload` stops with "SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly" | Run the same `upload` command again. It skips what is done and continues with the missing parts. |
| `upload` cannot connect | Use the Neon URL with `sslmode=require` and check that Docker Desktop is running. |
| Home page shows no rails after the upload | Restart the service (Step 2.4). The logs should show `unpacked artifact bundle` and `recommender engine ready`. |
| Service restarts with "out of memory" | Move the web service to the paid Starter plan. Our measurement fits 512 MB, but this is the fix if real traffic needs more. |

## Trying the hosted setup on the laptop first (optional)

The same container can run locally against an empty database, which is how this setup was tested:

```powershell
docker build -t cinematch:local .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --memory 512m -e DATABASE_URL=<a local test database URL> -e JWT_SECRET=<any long random text> cinematch:local
```

Then run `deploy_data.py upload` with that database's URL and open <http://localhost:8000>.
